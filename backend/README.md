# Backend API Skeleton

This folder defines the planned backend architecture for the HireHelp system.
At this stage, it serves as a structural and documentation placeholder.

## Responsibilities

- Authentication and authorization
- Job and application management APIs
- Resume upload and processing endpoints
- Hiring workflow state validation
- Interview feedback storage

## Planned Structure

- routes/ → API route definitions
- controllers/ → Request handling logic
- services/ → Business logic layer
- models/ → Data models / schemas

## Notes

Backend implementation will be added in later development phases.
This structure is created to demonstrate system planning and separation
of concerns.
